## Roadmap

This is the roadmap for the project. It is a living document and will be updated as the project progresses.

- Write model to lp, mps files
- User-defined callbacks in optimization (like JuMP.jl, we can support lazy constraints and user-cuts to selected solvers)
- Compute conflict constraints of infeasible model
